    THINK OF HTML CONTENT LIKE A BOX = EVERYTHING IS A BOX   , CREATE IT LIKELY !


 Every website in the world is made of HTML & CSS 
.html file > becomes the web page , any output will be printed on the webpage without any code 
download any website > go to page source > ctrl s 


SUMMARY   
/* 	src is used in   		           >>>    img , iframe , audio , video ,  map  , src="app.js"
	name ="Male" name="Male"  	     >>> use name attribute in  each input tag  so that only one radio box (user - input ) can be selected 
	label in each input tag       	 >>> <input value ="ok"  >  for each input tage , where clicking on firstname - user get shifted to writing content part !  
  <link rel ="stylesheet" type ="text/css" href= "style.css" >  >>> link css file in ur html page  
  <scripts> app.js </scripts>      >>> link js files in ur html page 
  

QUESTSIONS 
Q difference between of tables  
 =  thead <td>, tbody <td>   >>> here table row and column|  how to add vertically 

 why shouldnt we use 
 =  <tr><th></tr>  <tr><td></tr>                  >>> theres no difference in using any method for creating the table !  , use any one of it ! 

why my background image is shwoing blur ? 
why my downloaded image is not showing blur     >>> close image in a div tag 










BASIC 

tags = <> </>
2 types   - open and close
one which will be opened and closed = because it has some content in it 
second one  which contains pics , links ....   </img>  , </br>  


<!DOCKTYPE html>    = tells browser what type of file/document we are giving  to the internet 
<html>              = root of the document 
<head >             = metadata includes (title , charactersets,links , scripts)
    <title >        = title of the webpage 
</head>             = closed the head tag 
<body >             = started the body tag includes -
    <!--comment-->> = comment 
    <p> FIRst </p1> = first para in the body  
    <h1>Head </h1>  = 1 heading   (has tags upto <h6> 6 headings starting from h1 to h6 )
</body>             = closed the body tag 

if opened , we need to close the tags as well 



BRIEF 
These types , styles ( width  height ) , classes ,  href  are generally inside elements only 
check the synatx of opening and closing when making elements ! 
check " " should be present inorder to make ur code work 
found error when trying to redirect pages with anchor tags =  use correct index.html site inorder to make other html pages work with you 


ELEMENTS                      = <body> <h1> - <h6> , <p> , <br> </body>

ATTRIBUTES ( goes inside elements ) =  LANG     - <html lang = 'en '> 
                                       
                                       LINKS    -   THESE ARE GIVEN BY <a> ATTRIBUTE    =   CAN BE TEXT , IMAGE , MAIL , BUTTON , RELATIVE ( link to other html files )
                                                  Link Titles                    = creating title inside href    <a href ="wwe.com" title ="go to wwe site"> WWE </a>
                                                  open links on image            = by putting image inside links <a href="url"> <img src = "location"> </a>
                                                  link to an email address       = by going inside               <a href ='mail.com'> send email </a>
                                                  Use button as Link             = using button                  <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
                                       
                                       IMAGES   - <img  src ='file' alt ='description' width ="400" height = "600" alt ="description"> 
                                      
                                       HEADINGS - <h1> Most important heading </h1>
                                       
                                       (print accordingly - <pre>  )   (horizontal break  - <hr>  )   ( break line - <br> )
                                       
                                       PARAS    - <p  style ="color:red" ; title = "tushar" ;background-color:blue > 
                                                - <p  style ="font-family:courier;"> Your Content. </p>
                                                - <p  style ="text-align:center  ;"> Your para   . </p>
                                                - <p  style = "margin:0" ;         >             . </p>
                                       
                                       <mark>description</mark> </p>

                                        <styel>    .prep_name {width ="500" height = "400"}   </style> 
                                        CLASSES  - <img class = "prep_name" >  image gets class ATTRIBUTES , any element get this class attributes 

style , href , target , type , b , pre , br , hr , width , height 
table , border , colspan , rowspan                                

'''


Notes 
. <h1> - can repeat these headings but think of it as the main heading of the book (should be 1 <h1>)
       - h1 has the biggest font , h6 the smallest 

.<body>
- <p>  - can be inside <head> , <body>
       - <b> inside para </b> = make words BOLD
       - <i> tushar </i>      = italic 
       - </br>                = break line
       - <pre> content </pre> = content will look same as u type code 

- <img  src='' , alt='' width ='400' height = 400>  />    = src - location of images  , alt - description of the image (wont show on website until theres an issue with the image to load )
  - set width and height of the image 
  - (if ur using chrome for getting image from C drive - it wont recognize it because the chrome dont has access to it !)
  - google use this alt tag inorder to specify user about the image to be shown in the website !


- <ol type = "A"> </ol>            = add order list with numbers having index  (like enumerate)
  - <li> ok,tushar,malhan </li>    = content inside list WITH index number  , is repeatable 
  - <> type = "A" will index list <l1> according to alphabets  , I = roman numerals , a = small characters index 

- <ul style ="list-style-type:circle">  = give unordered list without index number 
  - <li> Your first heading </li>       = similar to ordered list , is repeatable , can give multiple styles - circle,square , None 
</ul>



.TABLE
<table>
  <tr>       table row
      <th>       table heading
  </tr>      row ended
  <tr>
    <td> </td>    table data
  </tr>
</table>

add data and headings under row  seperately <th> and <td>   UNDER <tr> for both elements  
- but if u want data to printed horizontallly               UNDER <tr> use <th> & <td>



. Add styles  
- use it anywhere ( inside body , img , h1 , )
- use   ;  to add methods 

<h1 style = "margin:0 ; text-align:center" >    = use ; text align:center inorder to shift words in the middle   
 ( In text align:center  - <pre> tag will overrule this code and will print accordingly )
 
<p p style="padding: 40px ; font-size:25px;" >  = add whitespace manually upto specific pixels 
  My second paragraph 
 </p>

<style = width = 100%  "margin":0 >             = gives index to the image 
<style = "margin":0;font-size:480; >            = remove whitespace  , add font-size 480

<h1 style='background-color: #f2f6ff;'>         = background color specific element   like head , body , title ....


. <div>   - use as container for other html elements 
. <span>  - have multiple elements in one line !  
  (use it to create minibar for ur website where - About , contact , Home will be mentioned )


Q what if u need to change style for 100 elements ? - u won't wanna do it manually 
- Use classes  for that !
Create class in any element  by 
<img class='base_syntax'>
Use .class name {
    define elements               anywhere = i did it under head > under style  > .
}                            by

.base_syntax{
    width:350;
    height:350;}                               >>> this adjustment is made where class ='name_of class' is given , as it will copy paste properties 



-         < href =' url' >  add links to the html page 
<a href="https://www.wwe.com/"  target = "_blank " > wwe </a>            - <a>     = indicates the link's destination
 - target  = will open the website to the new tab 
 - wwe >   = shows it on ur website , what link name u give 


<a href = "https://www.edyoda.com/"  target ="_blank">
<img src ="https://picsum.photos/536/354" 
    alt = "my pic w"
    style = width = '200' height = 250 > 

 - anchor tag will allow image to be clickable , thus open ur site in new tab !


links can be absolute path  URL's  or  path based on ur folders  
 - <li class ="menu_item"> 
        <a href="/index.html">Home</a> </li>       = when someone clicks on "Home" in our website  >>> index.html is loaded 
      
      
      <li class ="menu_item"> 
        <a href="/about.html"> About</a> </li>     >>> here about .html is loaded
      
      
      <li class ="menu_item"> 
        <a href="/contact.html">Contact</a> </li>  >>> here contact.html is loaded   as we create these pages in our folder 
      





This Class Style will create a menubar type 
<style>
    .menu_item {
      display:inline;                      inline will print it horizontallly
      padding:12px 16px;
      background-color:lightblue             Home   contact   about 
    }
  </style>                                       






- same as classes we use id (which includes styles of the formatted elements)
 just like classes we use    .class_name   
 here    under < styles >    #id_name { background-color:lightblue; padding:16px }  is given    </styles>
 use this id type in ur elements  id=id_name
Think of id as sub-classes    - CONNECT WITH IMAGES (so that when u click on text - u get the image !)


 

EACH HTML ELEMENT WILL WORK EITHER LIKE BLOCK ELEMENT ( DIV ) OR INLINE ELEMENT ( SPAN )
. < div >   BLOCK ELEMENT 
 - always start from new line 
 - takes up full width available 

. <span>   INLINE ELEMENT 
 - not start with new line 
 - takes necessary width as necesary 


Use to embed things in ur website  (all 3 does same things )
. <embed> 
. iframe  = use it to display another webpage from ur current website ! 
 (use it for counter compare websites )
 
 <iframe src = "youtube.com/tusharmalhan" > </iframe>
  (same as maps - use it to copy n paste in iframe  )

. <object data = "" > </object>




HOW CAN USER HEAR FROM YOUR WEBSITE ? 
. <audio controls >   
    <source src = "play.mp3" type = "audio/mpeg" >             type - format type of mp3  ! 
    Your browser Does not support Audio file                 custom message =   if browser does not support audio files 
</audio>                                                          


. <video width ="100" height ="100" controls >                  REMOVE CONTROLS , USE AUTOPLAY  
      <source src = "video.mp4" type = "video/mp4" >          same like audio , use it to display video 
      your browser does not support video                     custom message  = if browser does not support video 
</video>                                                      CREATE VIDEO AND MEDIA PLAYERS 




. use html keywords to print them ! via html entities   
(    & for characters  )
instead of < >  inorder to print  <div>  use 
&lt; div &gt;   
. give symbols
&copy    - for copy right sign
&$       - for dollar   
#128516  - for smiley emoji


. non semantic elements 
  (like div and span)

. semantic element   = element with a meaning for both browser and developer 
  new semantic elements in html 5 = ( like form , table , article )



. map      =  MULTIPLE LINKS FROM SINGLE IMAGE 
 <img src="wow.jpg" usemap="#image_map">
                <map name="image_map">                                             <!-- use image to connect multiple links from the image ! -->
          <area alt="tushar" title="tushar" href="https://www.tusharmalhan.com" coords="1132,321,78" shape="circle">
          <area alt="google " title="google " href="https://www.google.com  " coords="504,96,951,701" shape="rect">
          </map>
  



. FORMS    (data gets submitted via GET , POST METHOD )
           ( action - tells where data needs to be tranferred )
<form method ="GET/POST" action = "">          (if data needs to get to  any other page type in "action="page_name" )
    Name:
      <input type = "text">           >>> take user input 
      <div>
              <input type ="submit">  >>> submit button !
      </div>
</form>

< input type  = "text" , "color" , "Date" , "email" , "number" ,"reset", "password", "url" , "hidden"(for developers)
                "range" min ="100" max="5000"
                ( Value="ok"  - ok will be shown instead of submit )  ( maxlength = "20" length of characters )  (read - which user can't change ) 
                ( placeholder ="enter name" - hint for the value that user will type in )
                (autocomplete="on")         - which will pre defined suggesstions 
                ( required   - will force user to complete the record )
                ( min  max   = use for number attribute , step = will skip the number  ) 
<  input type = "file">      - like u submit ur resume in the webpage
                ( use multiple attribute in file in order to have multiple files updated )

            
- Textarea
 inside form  = user input text 
 <textarea rows="20" cols="50" placeholder="write ur content "> </textarea>


- Drop down menu button
<select size ="2" multiple>                               # multiple will allow multiple options to select 
 <option value = "option1" selected > coffee </option>    # selected will give default option 
 <option value = "option2"> milk coffee </option>
</select>

- optgroup = select from group of values 


- radio button = select from the following 
 <input type ="radio"> Male          
 <input type ="radio" checked> Female                   # by default with checked female is selected     
 <input type ="radio"> other          


- check box (same like radio , but in checkbox and can provide  multiple selection for user  )
 <input type ="checbox" > Money
 <input type ="checbox" > Love



- Datalist 
(when we google search we have suggesstions for each character)
first we input from user 
<input type ="text" list ="search" >
       <datalist id ="search">              we need to give id
       <option value ="apple"> 
       <option value ="strawberries"> 
       <option value ="applepie"> 
       <option value ="car"> 
    </datalist>
<input type ="submit" >


- Labeling (when we click on name - we get shifted to check box !)
<label for="fname">First Name</label>
<input type ="text" id ="fname"> <br>
<input type ="submit">



. SEO tags (inside head) so that our website is undestood by browser
 <meta name ="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />    here google willnot index or follow page or read it 


.FAVICON (inside icon) = icon key for ur website  inside head
<link rel ="icon" href ="wow.jpg" type ="image/jpg">

download favicon generator from web , so that u can use it any browser 



CONNECT UR STYLESHEET.CSS TO UR index.html

<head>
<link rel ="stylesheet" type ="text/css" href= "">
</head>


. Use  scripts 
<script>
